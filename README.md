# Front-End-Avansat
 This project is for the Advanced Frontend course, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. The project uses reusable components and has multiple routes that communicate with each other. It includes private routes and a login/register feature, which allows users to access certain parts of the application that are restricted to logged-in users. The back end of the application is implemented using Firebase.
